1. **Reverse a String**:
 Write a Java program to reverse a given string without using built-in functions.

2. **Check for Palindrome**
 Develop a Java program to check if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forwards and backward.

3. **Count Vowels and Consonants**:
 Create a Java program to count the number of vowels and consonants in a given string.

4. **String Anagrams**:
 Write a Java program to check if two strings are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another.

5. **Remove Duplicate Characters**:
 Develop a Java program to remove duplicate characters from a string without using additional data structures.

6. **String Compression**:
 Write a Java program to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, "aaabbbccc" becomes "a3b3c3".

7. **Check for Substring**:
 Create a Java program to check if one string is a substring of another.

8. **String Rotation**:
 Write a Java program to check if one string is a rotation of another. For example, "waterbottle" is a rotation of "erbottlewat."

9. **String Reversal in Words**:
 Develop a Java program to reverse the words in a given string while maintaining the word order.

10. **Longest Palindromic Substring**:
 Write a Java program to find the longest palindromic substring in a given string.

11. **String Permutations**:
 Create a Java program to generate all permutations of a given string.

12. **Count Words in a String**:
 Write a Java program to count the number of words in a given string.

13. **Check for Pangram**:
 Develop a Java program to check if a given string is a pangram. A pangram is a sentence that contains every letter of the alphabet at least once.

14. **String Concatenation**:
 Write a Java program to concatenate two strings without using the `+` operator.

15. **Most Common Character**:
 Create a Java program to find the most common character in a given string.

16. **Remove Whitespace**:
 Develop a Java program to remove all whitespace from a string.
